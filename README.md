# Group-9---Database-Project
This is a project where we create a command-line e-commerce store. Your user must be able to login or create an account once the system begins. They cannot proceed without logging in, so make sure wrong choices are accounted for and there's a choice for them to quit if they don't want to log in. Only one user type need be accounted for (specifically, a customer).

Once logged in, your user needs to be able to interact with all the items, shop, and manage their account.

Here are the specific requirements once logged in:

ItemsView all items in a category
View all items in the user's shopping cart
Add item from a category to their shopping cart
Remove an item from their shopping cart
Checkout the items currently in their cartRemoves items from the user's shopping cart
Edits stock information to lower the stock accordingly
Add an order to the user's order history
View the logged in user's order history
Edit the user's accountEdit the shipping information
Edit the payment information
Delete their account (and all the order history/shopping cart data associated with it)
Logout
 

Each 4-person group will have one category of inventory item (or their choice), while each 5-person group will have two categories of inventory items (of their choice). Make sure the inventory item(s) is well-rounded and has information relevant to being an inventory item (such as price and stock number, etc) and relevant to the item itself.

For 5-person groups: Assume each category of item would be handled independently. So, if you had books and movies as your two item categories you'd have the following for requirements:

View all books
Add book to cart
Remove book from cart
View all movies
Add movie to cart
Remove movie from cart
Checkout everything in cart
...etc
